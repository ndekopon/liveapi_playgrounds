## LiveAPI 2.3 - Season 24.1 - 2025-03-25

### Added

- `PauseStateChangeNotification` message to broadcast when a `PauseToggle` has been submitted

	- As mentioned in the documentation, call the `CustomMatch_GetLegendBanStatus` to see what values are acceptable
	
### Changed

- `PauseToggle` messages are replied to with the `PauseStateChangeNotification` message instead of the generic `RequestStatus` message.
